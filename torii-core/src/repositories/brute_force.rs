/// Repository for brute force protection data.
///
/// This trait defines the storage operations needed for tracking failed login
/// attempts and managing account lockout. Implementations should use an append-only
/// log of failed attempts, with lockout status determined by counting recent attempts.
///
/// # Security Considerations
///
/// - Failed attempts should be recorded for all email addresses, even non-existent ones,
///   to prevent user enumeration attacks.
/// - The `cleanup_old_attempts` method must check the `locked_at` status to prevent
///   accidentally unlocking accounts during cleanup.
/// - IP addresses stored for auditing may be subject to data retention regulations.
